🏢 Smart Elevator System
A real-time interactive elevator management system built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Watch 8 elevators move dynamically through an 18-floor building while the smart allocation algorithm finds the optimal elevator for your journey.

✨ Features
🎯 Smart Elevator Allocation

Intelligent Algorithm: Finds the nearest available elevator based on distance and direction
Real-time Optimization: Considers elevator movement patterns for fastest service
Visual Feedback: Green highlighting shows your assigned elevator throughout the journey

🏗️ Building Structure

18 Floors Total: 14 regular floors + Ground floor + 3 basement levels (B1-B3)
8 Active Elevators: Named A through H, each moving independently
Realistic Physics: Elevators move at different speeds with natural acceleration

🎮 Interactive Controls

Current Floor Selection: Dropdown menu or click on floor labels
Number Pad Interface: Easy-to-use buttons for destination selection
Mobile Responsive: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

🎨 Visual Experience

Real-time Animation: Smooth elevator movements with 60fps rendering
Color-coded Status:

🟡 Golden: Normal elevator operation
🟢 Green: Elevator serving your request
🟢 Light Green: Elevator stopped for pickup/drop-off
⚪ Gray: Elevator not on current floor


Modern UI: Glassmorphism design with gradient backgrounds

🔄 Complete Journey Simulation

Request Processing: Select destination and get optimal elevator recommendation
Pickup Phase: Elevator comes to your current floor (turns green)
Travel Phase: Maintains green color while traveling to destination
Drop-off Phase: Stops at destination floor for passenger exit
Return to Service: Resumes normal random movement patterns

🛠️ Technology Stack

Frontend: Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
Styling: Custom CSS with Flexbox/Grid layouts
Animations: CSS animations + JavaScript requestAnimationFrame
Responsive: Mobile-first design with media queries
No Dependencies: Zero external libraries or frameworks

🎯 How It Works
Smart Allocation Algorithm
javascript// Factors considered for elevator selection:
- Distance from current floor
- Elevator direction (bonus for moving towards user)
- Current elevator load/availability
- Estimated arrival time
Real-time Physics Engine

Each elevator has independent speed, direction, and movement patterns
Collision detection at floor boundaries
Realistic acceleration and deceleration
Random direction changes for natural behavior

🎮 Usage Instructions
Getting Started

Set Your Location: Use the dropdown to select your current floor
Choose Destination: Click any floor button on the number pad
Follow Recommendation: The system will highlight your optimal elevator
Track Journey: Watch your elevator come to you, then take you to your destination

Advanced Features

Quick Floor Selection: Click directly on floor labels in the building view
Real-time Status: Monitor all elevator positions and directions
Journey Tracking: See complete route (pickup → destination) in status panel
